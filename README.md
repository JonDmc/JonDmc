Hello! 👋
</br> 
Jon here! 👋
</br>
I'm an aspiring Full-Stack developer that likes games and food 🎮🍲
</br>
Currently working on mastering the language of Javascript and Python. Really open to learn different languages as well. 
</br>
My repo consists of projects that are *"game-inspired"* as well as programs that tests/showcase my knowledge on data structure and algorithms and the fundamentals on the following languages/frameworks :
   <ul>
<li>
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
</li>
<li>
React, Postgres, Sequelize, MongoDB
</li>
<li>
Python
</li>
<li>
Express, Node.js
</li>
   </ul>
